The name of this game is Millennium Quest 2000. The back story of the game is in the first 4 instruction pages. This is a tile based puzzle game, but what makes it very hard, is that you don’t know the tile configuration that will make you win the game. What’s even worse, you only get 100 moves or else you lose. 






SPOILER: If you’re fed up of trying to figure it out, you have to arrange the tiles in ascending order.
