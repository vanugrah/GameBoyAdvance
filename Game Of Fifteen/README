The name of this game is Millennium Quest 2000. The back story of the game is in the first 4 instruction pages. This is a tile based puzzle game, but what makes it very hard, is that you don’t know the tile configuration that will make you win the game. 


SPOILER: If you’re fed up of trying to figure it out, you have to arrange the tiles in ascending order.
